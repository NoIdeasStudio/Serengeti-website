                <p>INT. APARTMENT, DULUTH, MN - DAY

                <br><br>In a near empty, economy apartment Kenny Dennis (70) sits on the edge of an unmade bed, his back to the camera. He picks up a tape recorder and clicks the record button. Rambling into the recorder he locks onto the phrase: “Don’t get jammed up”. He repeats it, over and over, rising to his feet, yelling this mantra into his tape recorder.

                <br><br>BEGIN FLASHBACK:

                <br><br><br>EXT. CITY STREET, CHICAGO - DAY

                <br><br>It’s a gorgeous green early summer day full of sun. A figure stands on the sidewalk talking into a payphone.

                <br><br>SUPERIMPOSE: 15 years earlier

                <br><br>It’s the classic Kenny Dennis, just younger. Big glasses, even bigger mustache. Blue collar work shirt. Name patch on his chest: “The Deacon”. He’s full of positive energy. He’s talking to his wife Jueles. Kenny asks when Jueles is coming home. He takes down list of things she needs him to pick: nails, wigs, wheels. Sweetly, he’s tells her he misses her. When she gets back to Chicago he’s gonna make her hot toddies, give her foot massages. A horn honks. A voice calls Kenny back to the beer truck. He says good-bye to Jueles and hangs up.

                <br><br>BEGIN MONTAGE:

                <br><br>The song “Dennehy” starts to play. Its first line of, “This is for Jueles” is punctuated by a flat of beer hitting the ground.

                <br><br>Kenny hauls beer down the sidewalk. A black, private taxi drives by. The side of the car read: S-CAR-GO. Below that, a slogan: “Join the Slow Ride Movement”. CURTIS (55), a large African-American man yells out to Kenny from the driver’s seat. Kenny happily shouts back, “Looking good Curtis”. Kenny takes the beer into a bar.

                <!-- <br><br>The beer truck drives past a strip club called Roger’s. On the marquee: “Performing tonight, LaTanya”. -->

                <br><br>Kenny is moving cases of beer down a sidewalk. He  passes a salon. MAUREEN (45) a short Asian woman calls to Kenny from a nail salon chair. She yells at Kenny through the glass window. She tells him to pick up chops for the picnic.

                <br><br>Inside a grocery store, Kenny makes a deal with a butcher. They trade a case of beer for some chops. Kenny asks the guy throw in a few brats too.

                <br><br>Outside, Kenny stops to take a turn at bat with some kids playing whiffle-ball in an alley. He cracks a homer. Kids cheer Kenny’s name. The horn on the beer truck rings out.

                <br><br>The beer truck drives past a boarded up building roped off with police tape. The sign above it reads Bubbles ’n’ Fun.

                <br><br>Inside a dark tavern Kenny drops cases of beer on the bar. JOJI (50), a Japanese man worn down from years of partying and substance hangs off the bar. Joji tries to hand Kenny some pills. Kenny tells Joji he doens’t need no stinking drugs, just baseball gloves and food. Kenny tells Joji to join him at the Memorial Day picnic. Joji passes out.

                <br><br>Kenny pushes an empty cart across the street. A green Geo Tracker comes to a screeching halt, inches from hitting Kenny. The driver, EDDIE (50), looking very similar to Kenny leans out the window and laughs. Eddie makes fun of Kenny for still working on the beer truck. Eddie tells Kenny he’d be winning at life if Kenny had only invested his fortunes.
                Eddie calls Kenny a perennial loser. Kenny shoots back that it’s gonna be Eddie losing when they square off at the picnic.

                <br><br>Kenny heads back to the beer truck as the sun begins to set behind the Chicago skyline.


                <br><br><br>INT. BEER TRUCK - DAY

                <br><br>A sweaty Kenny gets in the truck to find the driver, TONY KIM (27) scribbling down notes in a little journal. Kenny asks Tony why he doesn’t help out more. Tony argues that he’s the one with the CDL license, plus he’s not content living the blue collar live. Tony is gonna be a rapper someday.

                <br><br>Kenny advises Tony that rapping won’t pay the bills. Rappin’ ain’t the key to happiness. Tony argues that Kenny is a washed-up has-been, who only rapped about stupid simple things. The truck drives down busy city streets. Other cars pass-by seeing these grown men trade barbs, their fingers getting into each others face. At a red light, Tony and Kenny’s squabbles turns into an epic rap battle.

                <br><br>When the light turns green horns honk. Tony falls silent, frustrated. He drives on. Kenny declares himself the winner. Kenny pops in a tape as he continues to mock Tony. The song “Wheels” starts up. The beer truck drives into the sunset as Tony proclaims that Kenny doesn’t know shit about good music, to fuck off, and find another beer truck to work  on.

                <br><br>BEGIN VIDEO INSERT:

                <br><br>Nepali music news program. A narrator speaks Nepali. She explain how international pop sensation STACE has been FOUND! A montage of stills and video present Stace as a thirty- something diva, decked out in wild costumes that would make Lady Gaga blush. A quick wrap-up of her career details how this promising young orphan from the streets of Chicago became a sensation around the world.

                <br><br>While Stace never found success back in the USA, she did set  a world record for recording her hit single “Lets Duet” in  over 450 different languages. For the past twenty years Stace has continued to perform this one hit while amassing fame and fortune like few others have ever  seen.

                <br><br>Then just after her 278th sold-out show of her 5th consecutive world tour Stace went missing. Rumors abound. Some believe Stace is secretly recording her follow up single. Tributes and vigils have been held as others think Stace is being treated for a terminal disease. A few even speculation she’s being held for ransom.

                <br><br>The narrator tells us that now, a year after Stace’s disappearance, a fan in the Svalbard has cellphone video believed to be of Stace. Hand-held amateur footage shows Stace in a small airport terminal. POTTERY (50’s), a white hippie chick with dreadlocks and a witchy aura, escorts Stace to a car. Pottery shields Stace from the crowd. A fan gets close enough with their cellphone to capture pop off a question. “Where  are you headed, Stace?” The only thing Stace replies is: “Kenny, Kenny  Dennis.”

                <br><br>END  VIDEO INSERT.


                <br><br><br>INT. NEPALI TV STUDIO, KATHMANDU, NEPAL - DAY

                <br><br>Nepali TV studio. Music journalists, editors, and producers finish watching the clip we just saw. They think it’s great, Everyone starts shouting their lunch orders to WESLEY (30), a young American intern. Wesley, speaking Nepali, recites the orders back, continually screwing up each order.

                <br><br>SHAKYA (60’s) an suited executive producer silence everyone. Wes ducks out to get lunch. Shakya is angry. He feels that the video is not complete until they uncover who this Kenny Dennis person is and why Stace is looking for him? The young Nepali music journalists joke about who Kenny Dennis might be, most of them think it’s not important, but Shakya insists it must be someone important, maybe someone back in Chicago.

                <br><br>None of the journalists want to go to America to track down the answer. They make excuses. America is too crime ridden. They don’t like the food. Their English is not that good.

                <br><br>An English speaking voice pipes up. The voice belongs to DEREK (50’s). His face is obscured by shadows. His voice is soft, but sinister. “Why not send Wesley?” At that very moment Wesley stumbles through the door spilling lunch orders.

                <br><br>Shakya asks Wesley if he’d like to return to America. Wes pleads not to go. He’s just an intern. Derek reminds Wes that he’s been an intern for eleven years. Together Shakya and Derek agree, Wesley will go find out who is Kenny  Dennis.


                <br><br><br>INT. DENNIS’ HOME, CHICAGO - EVENING

                <br><br>Kenny sips an O’Doul’s while he talks on a phone mounted to the wall. With frustration fueled by hunger Kenny shouts his order into the phone: One large pizza with onion, onions, onions. Lots of onions.

                <br><br>Kenny’s much younger brother, TANYA (25) is fixated on a television program. The host of the local TV show is interviewing a woman who offers aerobic pole dancing classes. Tanya marvels at the woman’s pole control.

                <br><br>Interrupting Kenny, Tanya asks his brother if he thinks he should take this woman’s class. Kenny asks the pizza shop to hold. Kenny walks Tanya to a stripper pole installed in their living room. Kenny gives Tanya a pep talk. Tanya begins pole dancing. Kenny goes back to the phone. He starts to give the pizza shop employee and insanely long list of directions:

                <br><br>”You go right, you go right, you go left, you go right, you  go right, you go right, you go left, you go right, a right, a left, you go right, a right, a right, you go right, you go left, you go right, you go left, you go right, you go left, you go left, you go up, you go down, you go down…”

                <br><br>There’s a knock at the door. Kenny yells at Tanya to answer  the door. Tanya collapses from the stripper pole, picks himself up, and answers the  door.

                <br><br>Wesley stands at the door. He clutches a video camera. Nervously, he asks if this is the home of Kenny Dennis. Tanya, seeing the camera, asks what this is about. Wesley explains he has been sent here to finish a video piece about Stace. Tanya’s eyes light up at the mention of Stace. Tanya steps outside slightly closing the door behind him. We can still hear Kenny on the phone, loudly going on and on with these  direction.


                <br><br><br>EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS

                <br><br>Tanya asks Wesley about Stace, how she is, where she is, how is she. Tanya assumes Wesley knows Stace personally. Wesley explains Stace is a huge superstar, he’s just an intern. He corrects himself, a video journalist.

                <br><br>Wesley divulges that Stace might be looking for a Kenny Dennis. He wonders if Tanya knows why Tanya lies, expresses disappointment and worry. Wesley peers through a crack in the door, asks again if he can just get a few words with Kenny,  all he wants is a quick interview. Tanya says now is not be a good time. Kenny is really hungry, really grouchy. Wesley offers to take them all to a rib shack he saw up the street.


                <br><br><br>INT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS

                <br><br>Kenny hearing the word “shack” drops the phone. Kenny starts yelling to the semi-closed door, “Who’s out there Tanya?
                <br><br>Who’s talking about Shaq? Who wants to know about Shaq O’Neal and the KDz? Shaq stepped to the Deacon and that jolly green giant got cut.” Kenny’s tirade goes on. The phone is just dangling by its chord. The voice on the other end of the phone is trying to repeat back the lengthy directions Kenny just gave them.


                <br><br><br>EXT. DENNIS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS

                <br><br>Tanya insists this is not a good time, Wes has upset Kenny. Wesley doesn’t know what he said to upset Kenny. Tanya suggests that maybe Kenny will have calmed down by the Memorial Day picnic. Maybe Wesley can try again then. Tanya slips inside, closing the door behind him. Wesley listens through the door as he hears Tanya calming Kenny.

                <br><br>Wesley walks away from the house and takes a seat on the  curb. He pulls out a cellphone and calls Shakya in Nepal. Shakya asks if Wes has found Kenny. Wesley states that he talked to Kenny’s brother. At least he thinks Tanya might be Kenny’ brother though he is a bit younger. Maybe it’s his son or just a roommate.

                <br><br><br>INT. WARDROBE DEPARTMENT - DAY

                <br><br>ANDERS HOLMS (37) is being fitted for a ridiculous looking superhero costume. Wesley watches as Ders talks loudly into his cell phone. He’s complaining to his agent, saying he thought his agent got him a part in a Marvel movie. Ders starts yelling into the phone: Carvel? Like the ice cream company? So, this isn’t even a movie, it’s just a commercial?

                <br><br>When Ders sees Wesley he snaps his fingers at him and says, “You look familiar? Where do I know you from?” Wesley gets nervous. Ders snaps at him, “Hey dick-ass, Didn’t I give you my drink order?” Ders asks where the hell his Harmless Harvest coconut water is?

                <br><br>Wesley tries to explain he’s not a PA. Wesley tells him he’s a friend of Chitose. Ders immediately tells his agent he’s gotta go.

                <br><br>Ders gets out of costume, instructs Wesley to walk ’n’ talk with him. As they walk and take golf carts across the studio lot Ders continues making business calls while he praises Chitose and asks if Wesley knew how she helped him get his first break out of sketch comedy and into indie  films.

                <br><br>Ders rattles of a series of phony indie film titles. Wesley hasn’t seen any of them. He speculates they never played in Nepal. Ders asks what Wesley is doing in Hollywood. Wesley says he’s actually working out of Chicago, trying to do a documentary about Kenny Dennis. Ders stops suddenly and says, “Kenny Dennis?”

                <br><br>BEGIN FLASHBACK:

                <br><br>Ders explains how he first met Kenny Dennis back in Chicago at the Sharper Image on Michigan Avenue. A middle school aged Der is looking at a Lazer Tag set when he over hears a raucous coming from the back of the store.

                <br><br>Kenny is at the customer service counter trying to return a fogless shaving mirror that he says keeps fogging up. The manager will only give Kenny store credit. On his way out Kenny sees Ders, offers to use the store credit to buy Ders a shower radio unit, gave Ders his phone number and wishes Ders a Merry Christmas.

                <br><br>END FLASHBACK.

Wesley says Kenny sounds like a really nice guy, Ders agrees, asks Wesley to give him a moment, there’s someone else in the showers that Ders has been trying to reach about a TV deal.

                <br><br>Ders returns to where Wesleys was showering. Wesley goes back to saying that Kenny seems like a pretty nice guy. Ders stops cleaning himself and says, “Well, there’s two sides to Kenny.”

                <br><br>SUPER IMPOSITION: 2010

                <br><br><br>EXT. DRIVING THROUGH LOS ANGELES - DAY

                <br><br>Ders is driving Kenny through the Los Angeles, pointing at landmarks as they pass-by. In his voice over Ders explains that things were going good for Ders, Workaholics was picking up steam, money was coming in from commercials, so he thought he’d treat his old friend Kenny Dennis a trip to Los Angeles. Maybe even introduce Kenny to some people, because you know they were all loving Dennehy. Maybe Ders could get some sort of project going, something to help Kenny out.

                <br><br>Kenny spends most of the drive complaining about the city, not being built on a grid, about the heat again. He just wants to know where they filmed Hunter. None of the Star maps have anything about Hunter. Ders gives up on the tour of LA.


                <br><br><br>INT. DERS’ APARTMENT - DAY

                <br><br>Kenny is on the phone talking with Jueles, he wishes she was out there with him. He understands she’s still working for a better future Kenny tells Jueles that, no, he did not see Tom Sellack.

                <br><br>Ders pops his head from another room and asks Kenny to hurry up they gotta leave now if they are gonna make it on time for their  reservation.

                <br><br>Kenny hangs up on Jueles. Then he says, “what are you talking about, our reservation is in an hour, I still have time to finish another episode of Hunter.” Kenny goes back to watching Hunter on the TV.

                <br><br>Ders’ doesn’t understand why, but Kenny had brought all these VHS tapes of Hunter with him. It’s 2010, Ders had a hard time finding anyone that even owned a working VCR, so Kenny could watch those tapes, but those tapes helped Kenny calm down and that’s good because Ders had this big surprise waiting for Kenny at Ruth Chris’.

Ders is confused, not what he expected, but he goes with it, thinking it’s some sort of nostalgia trip, throw-back music. Then Kenny announces the band name: “PERFECTO!”.

                <br><br>Ders says it is funny and Kenny takes offense. Kenny lays into Ders about rap music not being a joke. He mentions how Ders made some video where Ders was rapping about wizards and shit.

                <br><br>Ders explains that was years earlier when he was just getting started in comedy, before he became a serious indie film actor, but Kenny just didn’t get that it was a joke. Sure,  the thing got a ton of likes, a ton of views, but Kenny  didn’t believe it. He couldn’t see anyone liking it.

                <br><br>Ders hangs up. Before they even take the stage Ders breaks it  to Kenny that he’s leaving. He’s catching the next plane back  to LA, because this Different Strokes thing is real and Perfecto is not real, it’s a joke. Ders never wanted to do this mall rap. He wanted to do real rap, like Tha Grimm Teachaz, like what Kenny used to do.

                <br><br>Ders turns the conversation to back Wesley. He asks “so, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna go talk to Lamont or ya know maybe you should stay here. I’d really like to take your life story, turn that into a movie. We could probably get an Oscar, people love that underdog shit.” Ders is getting called to set.

                <br><br>Wesley tells Derek he’s not so sure why Derek is obsessed with Stace. It’s clearly more than this video Nepal TV called for. Wesley’s just not so sure that Derek has Stace’s best interests in mind. Derek tells Wesley he’s meddling with the wrong guy.

                <br><br>Wesley states that he’s not worried, after the salvia video there is little Derek could do to him. Derek threateningly says, “Just wait and see. It’s been a long time since you had friends Wesley, real friends.”

Lamont asks who the hell is this guy and Kenny explains Lee’s gonna do a song or two on the new Grimm Teachaz album. Lamont’s uncertain about this plan, Lamont suggests they bring in Jueles, he’s heard her voice. It’s good. But Kenny explains Lee has money. He’s helping cover production costs.

                <br><br>Kenny tells the producer to get ready to record Lee. Kenny again vouches for Lee saying he’s gonna be the next big thing, he’s a genius, doing things like no one else is doing. The producer, sets Lee up in the recording booth, having to explain the whole process to a very uncertain Lee.

                <br><br>Lee starts recording this song with all these strange animal sex references in it. The producer stops him and asks what the heck is he doing. Lee thinks this is gonna be a club hit. The producer argues no one wants to hear this. The producer looks at Kenny.

                <br><br>Maureen counters that Kenny never let Jueles live out her dreams. He knew she wanted to sing. They always heard her singing in the shower. She had a beautiful voice. Kenny was probably jealous.

                <br><br>Curtis asks Maureen if this is really about her and the drums. The two of them start squabbling about Maureen’s dream to play drums at a Bulls. Maureen is mad because Curtis wouldn’t drive her to Rockford every night when she got a gig playing for the CBA team the Rockford Lightning. Curtis argues that the car is for business. Maureen says he just spends all that money on snails. The argument goes on and on with poor Wesley trapped in the back  seat.

We catch a flash of Jueles, decked out, heading out the door. Kenny hears her leave and says to himself, fine then American  Ninja 2  it is. He  settles into the couch. The  movie starts.

                Tom says he’s done doing movies. Sure, Three Men and A Baby was a hit, but ever since he had to turn down Raiders of the Lost Ark it’s been too many misses and not enough hits. He should have been Indiana Jones, not Mister Baseball. Maybe he should just go into another field, maybe music. If only he could find his muse.

                <br><br>Maureen’s narration comes in telling us how Jueles was in the ladies room, over hearing this all through the vent, so she just popped in her demo tape, started singing, pouring her heart out and Tom heard it.

And, can you blame Jueles for taking this opportunity, especially after the shit Kenny pulled at the Jive Record Showcase?

                <br><br>Wesley says Lamont told him all about that. Maureen asks if Lamont told him how Kenny broke his parole by going to that show? That fool could have gone to jail. That might have been the last straw for Jueles.

                <br><br>Curtis argues Kenny had to do it. That show could have launched the Teachaz. Mauren argues that Curtis is cop. He shoots back, ex-cop and anyways Kenny was just trying to make a future for himself and provide for Jueles.

He asks Dee-dee if she has any pictures of Kenny and Jueles. Dee-Dee’s warm demeanor turns cold. Dee-dee says she got rid of all those pictures after Jueles did her boy  wrong.

                <br><br>Like a protective mother Dee-dee tears down Jueles and builds up her boy, Kenny. Dee-dee asks if Wesley knew that even after Jueles left Kenny he looked after Jueles younger sister Stace, made her a star? Wesley drops a  record.

                Kenny is trying to convince Lamont that they need to get back in the studio and finish up their sophomore effort Da End Iz Near. Kenny has big plans for them to get out and tour. Kenny  is driven by a desire to not be overshadowed by Jueles and Tom Sellack. Lamont thinks Kenny did too much damage at the Jive Records showcase. Kenny thinks their beef with Shaq is good for their image. Maybe he should start some shit with Sellack too.

                <br><br>Kenny and Lamont spot Stace being hassled by some dudes. They  are trying to get her to join them in some sort of music act. One guys keeps saying he’s the other half of Right Said Fred. The other guy claims to have connections to the English Beat. Stace is cold and showing no  interest.

                <br><br>Kenny crosses the street. Kenny gets in these dudes’ faces. He’s standing up for Stace, telling them she’s already part of the Teachaz crew. One of them takes a swing and knocks Kenny down. Stace springs into actions. Kenny wants to get back in the fight. Lamont says, “Kenny let ‘em fight”. They both watch as Stace stomps the shit out of these  fools.

                <br><br>Kenny brushes himself off. Stace asks is he was serious about her being part of the Teachaz crew and hands him a  demo tape.

                <br><br>Kenny and Lamont are driving, Kenny pops in the tape. It’s the same tape we heard way earlier in the beer truck. Kenny is excited by the tape. Lamont is not feeling it. He reminds Kenny that he’s getting out of the rap game. He wants to pursue personal interests, expand his mind, be all those things Fresh Greg said he was, but really wasn’t.

                <br><br>Kenny tells Lamont he’s a fool. They could stop being rappers, be producers and still be in the game. Lamont says Kenny is just making up for losing Jueles and he best be careful with Stace. Kenny is trying to correct the past.
                Lamont is thinking about the future. The two argue as the car drives into the night.


                <br><br><br>INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

                <br><br>Kenny is working with Stace on a song. He’s hyping this show he landed for her, but she’s got cold feet about performing in front of an audience. She’s worried no one will show.
                Maybe they’ll think she’s just riding her sister’s coat- tails. Maybe they’ll think she’s the LaToya Jackson to  Jueles’ Janet Jackson. Kenny psyches her up saying she can do this. Kenny promises it’ll be a packed house. Stace wonders  if her sister is gonna make it to the show. Kenny ensures her that she’ll be there. He’s gonna patch things up with  Jueles.

                <br><br><br>BEGIN MONTAGE:

                <br><br>Kenny is on the phone calling everyone: Lamont, Kofi, Ders (as a kid), Curtis, Maureen, even Shaq. He’s trying to get them all to come to the show. No one answers his call. He just leaves pleasing messages on their machines as they ignore Kenny.

                <br><br>Between calls we see ads and promos for Jueles’ album.

                <br><br>Kenny attempts to get through to Selliac records. He’s calling from different pay phones. Using fake voices. He even has Dee Dee trying to call, pretending to be Jueles’ mom, but they know Jueles’ mom is dead. Dee-dee wraps up the montage by saying it was a good album, but it would have been better if she’d let Kenny produce it like he did with Stace’s demo.

                <br><br>Derek slithers out from the darkness of the club. He toys with Kenny, asking if Kenny is going to find a way to screw this up, like he did with Discoken, his country album, the Grimm Teachaz, Jueles. The mention of Jueles causes Kenny to lose it. He tells Derek not to talk about Jueles, don’t even look at Jueles. Derek lets Kenny know that he knows Jueles left him, Jueles is with Tom Sellack now. Kenny says it’s only a matter of time before he wins her back. When she see  how he’s helped Stace she’s bound to return. Dereke informs Kenny that Jueles is on her way to to Brazil, the start of world wide tour. Kenny freaks out and exits the show, hoping to catch Jueles.

                <br><br>As Kenny runs off Stace wraps up her song and exits the stage. She greats Tanya with a kiss on the cheek and ask Dee  Dee where Kenny is. She responds that he went to find Jueles. Stace wanders back to her green room. Derek slides in and compliments her, acts like a friend, but he’s buttering her up he’s preparing a drink and slipping a mickey into it.

Wesley apologizes and asks what she remembers after the concert. She says, not much. Stace became a star overseas, but we ain’t heard from her in years. Kenny went off and won back Jueles.

                <br><br>Dee-Dee says that her and Tanya would get postcards, those  two lovebirds were just traveling the globe, helping people out. She wish Jueles would have been as dedicated to Kenny as she was to all that charity. But, she didn’t have time to worry about those two. She had to get to raising Tanya.

Dee Dee is getting forced into retirement from her job at the slaughter house. Too many people are going vegan and she’s accepted a buyout. It’s not enough to keep living in there house. She’s got a lead on a good retirement community, but they won’t allow Tanya to live there with him. Tanya really wants his big brother Kenny to come back.

                <br><br>Curtis admits he misses his buddy Kenny. All that shit in the past is water under the bridge. But he has no clue where Kenny could be. Tanya pulls out a postcard from Nigeria.
                Curtis looks at it and says it’s a good lead. He asks Tanya if he has ever heard of the Lissachatina fulica aka the Giant African Land Snail. Curtis would really like to see one of those. He makes a deal with Tanya. Now that Curtis has retired from the force he’ll go look for Kenny. Tanya can stay in their upstairs room, so long as he promises to take care of Curtis’ snails while Curtis is gone.

                <br><br>Curtis talks about how he went to Nigeria and found his Giant Land Snail and proof that Kenny had been there. The tribesmen had painted the large snail shells like Zubaz that Kenny used to wear and they showed him the one pay phone in town that Kenny fixed.

Huts with working refrigerators, women who had learned to grown mustaches like Kenny’s. A town in Serbia that at Chicago style hot dogs, but they called them Kenny dogs. All along the way Curtis also tracked down rare snails to bring back to his sanctuary.

                <br><br>Kenny is shopping. Stace finds O’Doul’s and it triggers a flashback to the song O’Doul’s that Jueles  wrote.

                <br><br>The flashback is broken by Eddie, who is trying to get some Red O’Doul’s. Eddie remembers Stace. He starts asking about Jueles. Kenny interjects tells Eddie to not talk about Jueles. Reminds Eddie he’s going to see him on the softball field later. Kenny tells Stace they need to get going, don’t worry about Eddie, he’s no one. They gotta get back to the crew.

                <br><br><br>EXT. PARK, 4TH OF JULY SOFTBALL -  DAY

                <br><br>Everyone is there, Curtis, Maureen, Stace, Dee-Dee, Tanya, Pottery, Chitose, Joji, Larold, Kenny all cooking out and playing softball. Eddie has his own crew, almost a bizarro world version of Kenny’s friends and family. Wesley is on the bench, filming from the side.

                <br><br>Kenny is talking up his team on the bench. How he wants to show up Eddie in front of everyone. Wesley says to Kenny it would be nice if Jueles was here. Kenny thinks Jueles will make it out to this cook out. Kenny tries to explain that she’s not coming back, not until she solves all the worlds’ hunger. All of it. This bums out Stace. She wants to see her sister. She needs to just except that and get ready to play left field. Then, seeing Stace upset this makes Kenny  upset.

                <br><br>Dee-Dee is putting on catcher’s gear and she scold Wesley for mentioning Jueles. Her and Tanya begin to explain how thoughts of Kenny falls into these funks. It’s best to just let him enjoy the softball, the cookout, the good things.

                <br><br>Dee-Dee lies sick in bed. Kenny stands over her. In voice- over Tanya tells us how Kenny didn’t move for days. Kenny says he’s afraid to take his eyes off Dee-Dee. Tanya tells Kenny that all this worry isn’t doing him or Dee-Dee any good. Tanya begs Kenny to do something creative, something productive. He encourages him to sing about positive things, things that being him joy. Kenny argues that is stupid. Who is gonna listen to that. Rap is supposed to be tough, about the problems of life.


                <br><br><br>INT. DENNIS HOME

                <br><br>Kenny is still listless and depressed. Tanya persists and forces Kennya start listing the things he loves. We begin to hear the starts of Dennhey.

                <br><br>As the Dennehy video raps up, Dee-Dee’s narration tells us how that video was getting shared all over. People were emailing it and emailing it and emailing it. But, ya know Tanya and Kenny weren’t getting any money from that video.

                <br><br>Wesley chimes in saying he knows how that is. Then, like a proud momma, Dee-Dee proclaims that hearing the joy her son’s video was bringing to people must have healed her, because next thing you know she’s out of bed and back to normal.

                <br><br>Tanya explains how the next few years, things were good in the Dennis family. Dee-Dee was healthy, Tanya was able to get Kenny work doing syncs for commercials.

                <br><br>BEGIN MONTAGE:

                <br><br>We see a series of commercials Kenny did, sometimes we even see out-takes where he’s arguing with the director or Tanya or the business owner about the the commercial should go.

                <br><br>END MONTAGE.

                <br><br>We watch Kenny stuffing cash into envelopes and Tanya mailing it off to Jueles. Dee-Dee says that the money was pretty good, even with Kenny always taking a portion and sending it  to Jueles. She even replies that Kenny probably could have bought Jueles that lake house up in Wisconsin that Jueles used to talk about, but she’s not even sure if that would bring Jueles home. Jueles is a changed woman, says Dee-Dee, but Kenny he never changed. If he’s never gonna give up on that girl.

                <br><br>The disruptive yelling of Eddie and Kenny breaks up the flashback. Dee-Dee mentions how she wishes they won’t fight. It’s jut not right for brothers to fight like that. Wesley thinks she means Kenny and Tanya,. She says, no “Eddie and Kenny” revealing they are brothers front different dads. Dee- Dee looks at Wesley as says, “I got around. So  what?”

                <br><br>Wesley is confounded by the fact that Eddie and Kenny are related. Kenny returns to the dugout. Wesley apologizes for mentioning Jueles absence. Kenny says it’s no big deal. One day she’ll return. If they could just end hunger, she’d come home on the next flight.

                <br><br>Looking at his bank account Wesley realizes his video is still earning him money. He shows Kenny, offering to make a donation. Kenny says, thanks kid, but that’s not enough.
                They’d have to throw like a benefit concert or something if they were gonna end hunger and bring Jueles back.

                <br><br>We can see the gears turning in Kenny’s head. That’s it! He’s gonna throw a benefit to end hunger. The concert is gonna feature Perfecto and Stace will write a new song, the whole world will come to hear it…and the Grimm Teachaz are going to reunite!

                <br><br>Stace is gonna get to see her sister again. Kenny is gonna get his wife back. Wes has a sure fire ending for his documentary.

                <br><br>Stace thanks Tanya for helping her with this new song. She gushes on and on about how excited she is for this event. He tries to tell her something, something that’s weighing on him, a fear he’s got. She asks what it is. He’s about to tell her, but the he just says, “Kenny has a tendency to screw things up. I just don’t want him to screw this up.” Stace laughs at his fear and kisses him.

                <br><br>The exit door opens and Maureen asks if the love birds are done fooling around. Tanya is embarrassed. Stace tells everyone to go home and get some sleep. She tells Tanya she’ll see him later. Everyone but Tanya leaves.

                <br><br>Tanya asks who the heck are you. Derek replies, “I’m Derek.”

                <br><br>Derek corners Tanya. In a cool, cold, threatening way Derek tells Tanya that Stace is his and he’s not going to let anyone else have her. Tanya tells Derek he knows all about how Derek manipulated and controlled Stace. He knows the truth.

                <br><br>Derek replies, “And does Stace know the truth about her sister, about all that money you haven’t been sending her?” Tanya freezes with fright.

                <br><br>Derek gives a huge super villain monologue explaining how Kenny Dennis has twice ruined his career and he’d be a damn fool if he let Tanya and Kenny take his cash cow from him now. Derek threatens to ruin everything is Tanya does not let him take Stace with him. He also knows Tanya has been hiding away millions of dollars that Kenny has been sending to Jueles. Derek wants it all or Derek will destroy Tanya’s one chance of having true love.

                <br><br>Wesley is filmming Kenny as he’s on the phone with Jueles.

Kenny is going on and on about Stace  and how great she is and how the Grimm Teachaz are gonna kill it and how Jueles should come sing a song with the  Teachaz.

                <br><br>Kenny hangs up and Lamont and Kenny go back to working on Grimm Teachaz songs from Da End Iz Near. Lamont is wanting Kenny to learn to forgive people, he wants no scenes, no beef this time around.

                <br><br>Kenny asks why Lamont is putting this on him. Lamont tells him its because he’s seen Kenny do it before. Ders is there observing, just in awe of the Teachaz. He agress with Lamont. He’s seen Kenny shoot himself in the foot multiple times.

                <br><br>Once Kenny agrees that he’ll keep his ego in check Lamont and Ders surprise Kenny with a guest. It’s Shaq. We never see his face, but we hear his voice. He apologizes to Kenny for the comment about his mustache. He says it was probably just jealousy. Then he asks if he can get a spot on one of the Teachaz  songs.

                <br><br>Shaq tries to make something work. Kenny says he doesn’t think it’s working. Maybe Shaq can just stand there and look intimidating, but not to look at Jueles or even talk to her.

                <br><br>Stace is waiting for Tanya. She wants to be romantic, but Tanya looks as if he’s seen a ghost. Stace just thinks he’s nervous about the show. She tries to relax him. He breaks down in tears, mumbling how he’s afraid to lose Stace. How Kenny could fuck this all up again. She tells him to not worry about Kenny, to be his own man. They end up making love.


                <br><br><br>INT. DENNIS HOME, TANYA’S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

                <br><br>Tanya is passed out on the bed. Stace is looking around the room, admiring pictures of Dennis Dennis and Tanya. She opens a small box on Tanya’s dresser. Inside the box are picture postcards Kenny has sent back from his time overseas with Jueles. She’s looking through them when suddenly she  shrieks.

                <br><br>The postcards fall to the ground. Tanya wakes up. Stace is shaking. He asks her whats wrong. She holds up a postcard to him. We can’t see it. “What is this?,” she asks. In the postcard we see Kenny embracing a corpse of Jueles. He’s grinning, acting like she’s alive. Tanya desperately tries to explain. He was just a kid when he got that card. He didn’t know what it meant. He thought it was a costume, like the picture of his dad. It took him years to figure out what happened.

                <br><br>BEGIN FLASHBACK:


                <br><br><br>EXT. BRAZIL - DAY

                <br><br>We watch a small prop engine plane spiraling to the ground. We see Kenny watching from a distance as the plane goes down. Kenny is running through the amazon toward the crash site.
                Kenny is pulling Jueles body from the plane. He’s saying over and over that Jueles is going to be okay. She’s obviously lifeless.

                <br><br>Kenny is in a hotel room. He’s on the phone with Dee-Dee. Jueles corpse is on the bed, cleaned up, wearing sunglasses. He’s telling his mom that he’s okay. He won Jueles back. They are gonna quit music. It’s a dead-end lifestyle. Jueles and him are gonna help the less fortunate, build houses for the needy, fix their appliance. Dee-Dee asks Kenny to put Jueles  on the phone. Kenny lies and says Jueles is napping. He promises  to send postcards.

                <br><br>END FLASHBACK.


                <br><br><br>INT. DENNIS HOME, TANYA’S ROOM - DAY

                <br><br>Tanya, in tears, telling Stace not to be mad. There’s nothing he could do to bring Jueles back. When Curtis brought Kenny back, Tanya was just so happy to have his brother home that he kept it all a secret. He let Kenny live this lie. He took all the money Kenny was saving and put it in a bank account because he knows Kenny is sick and he needs help, but right now Kenny is happy. Everyone is happy. Stace simply says, “What about you? Were you happy? What about us?” Stace leaves.


                <br><br><br>EXT. MUSIC FESTIVAL GROUNDS - DAY

                <br><br>It’s the big show and it’s packed. There’s a huge stage, lots of tents, and people, tons and tons of people from all over the world here to see the debut of Stace’s first new song in over 20 years. The international fans make it look like the opening ceremonies to the Olympic games, but they are mixed with mall-rap fans there to see see Perfecto and old-school 90’s rap fans looking to see tha Grimm  Teachaz.

                <br><br>All of Kenny’s gang are there. Maureen has a food tent called Incredi-Bull Edibles. Dee-Dee is DJing between acts. Larold is selling copies of his book. Pottery is mixing up Ayahuasca and other natural medicines. Curtis is taking donations for his snail sanctuary.

                <br><br>Wesley and a team of documentary filmmakers are capturing bits and pieces of it all. Perfecto is on stage killing it with the whole crowd, but just off-stage Tanya is worrying about Stace. She’s no where to be found. He’s frantically asking everyone.

                <br><br>When Tanya returns to Stace’s trailer he finds Derek inside. Derek wants to know where Stace is and thinks Tanya is lying when he says he doesn’t know. Derek again threatens to tell Stace the truth, but Tanya informs him that Stace already knows. She knows everything.

                <br><br>Derek then asks, “What about your brother, does he know?”

                <br><br>Derek and Tanya race to the stage. Tanya gets to the stage  first and flashes his all access pass. When Derek tries to get backstage he is stopped by Chitose. She grills him. She obviously know him and his intentions for Stace. She won’t let him pass and tells her father Joji to keep an eye on Derek. Joji won’t let Derek on stage and instead hands Derek  a drink he has spiked. Derek passes out.

                <br><br>Tanya gets to the stage just in time to see Kenny and Ders exiting on the other side of the stage. Tanya and Wesley stand on the side of the stage, Wesley is filming. On the other side stands Stace. Kenny passes her and Stace tells Kenny that she’s not angry with him and to not live his life with regrets. He doesn’t understand what she means, but tells her that he knows she’s gonna knock ‘em dead.

                <br><br>Stace comes on stage, Maureen and Curtis and Larold are all there waiting. They start playing her new song, before she begins to sing she signals for them to stop. They do. Stace walks up to the mic and delivers this impassioned speech about the inspiration of her life, her sister Jueles. As the speech goes on Tanya watches in freight. Kenny appears behind Tanya. He thinks this speech is great. Wesley asks Kenny if Jueles has arrived yet. Kenny searching the crowd hoping Jueles has made it here in time to hear the speech.

                <br><br>Stace ends her speech by saying, “may she rest in peace.” Then she begins playing “Wildflowers” a brand new song that somehow the band magically knows how to play. Meanwhile, Kenny is on the side of the stage losing it, “What did she say? What? What did she say? No. No. No.” Wesley’s camera is capturing  it all.

                <br><br>Kenny is again forced to face the fact that Jueles is dead. Tanya tries to calm his brother down. Tanya tries to tell him it’s going to be okay. Kenny can’t handle it. He takes of running and he just keeps running. Tanya tells Wesley to turn the camera off.


                <br><br><br>INT. BOOK STORE, DULUTH - NIGHT

                <br><br>A sign advertises a book reading by Wesley who promoting his memoir  about surviving life as an internet sensation. The sign also advertises a book  signing by  Larold. Wesley  is going a Q&A where someone asks him about what he’s done since the video and before writing this book. Wesley explains he thought he was gonna make a name for himself with this documentary about a rapper named Kenny Dennis, but both that documentary and his viral video experience taught him that it’s right use other people’s pain for your fame or fortune, plus he lost track of Kenny before he could finish.

                <br><br><br>INT. DIVE BAR, DULUTH - NIGHT

                <br><br>Wesley is drinking at the bar. A guy comes up next to him and orders a drink. While the guy waits for his drink he turns to Wesley and says that was a good talk Wesley gave. Wesley thanks him. The guy then mentions this Kenny Dennis documentary and says it’s too bad that never happened. When the guy then uses a familiar Kennyism, Wesley looks up shocked.


                <br><br><br>INT. APARTMENT HALL WAY - NIGHT

                <br><br>The guy from the bar lets Wesley into the building and points to mailbox that says 6E DENNIS. As the guy takes Wesley up the stairs he explains how he’s just a contracted janitor hired to clean apartments. This past week he’s been cleaning this one apartment and listening to the guy next door as he’s ranting and  yelling all day long.

                <br><br>We start to hear the mad rambling from down the hall. It’s clearly Kenny’s voice. When Wesley and this janitor knock the door opens and there is 6E stands Kenny Dennis, minus the mustache. When Wesley says “Kenny? Kenny Dennis” The man in 6E responds, “No. My names Dave. Dave Cohn.”

                <br><br>FADE OUT.

                <br><br>THE END.<br><br>
